# Homework Instructions

In the past five weeks, we have covered about 80% of Python Basics. So we have started combining all these basic into solving more challenging problems, like we did in the week 4 homework.

It is very important to revisit these basics, and I encourage you to have a review by using some online free tutorials, which provides additional knowledge beyond what we have taught in class.

Please go to the [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) and go through the section called "Learn the Basics", and do the practices from "Hello World" to "Functions". These exercise will help you have a better understanding of Python basics.
