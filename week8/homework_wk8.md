# Homework for Week 8

In the class this week, we learned how to set up a pair of mico:bit from measuring accelerometer data for a moving object. We also inspect the captured dataset and created a plot of the data trend in Excel/Google Sheet. This is actually a typical workflow of conducting a scientific experiment.

I also explained the three dimensions/axis (x, y, and z) and inspected the change of acceleration data. If I flip the micro:bit by each dimension, the change is actually caused by gravity applied to the micro:bit.

These concepts in physics may take some time to fully understand, for the homework this week, we will further explore these concept by doing hands-on experiments.

## Task

The purpose of this task is to have more observations of accelerator data, and practice your skill of data capture, visualization and analysis.

1. Use the code I provided to you during the class, set up a measuring unit and a receiving unit.
2. Think about three situations that you can explore the change of acceleration data by firstly capturing such data.
3. Prepare your measure unit with battery power, and attach it to some object. Make sure the movement or possible shock should not damage the micro:bit. There are so many options for you to explore, just list a few examples:
   1. What does the acceleration data look like when an actual car moves/stops and turns? You can ask your parents to take a drive and record the data from in the car.
   2. Let the object free fall onto a sofa or a mat on the floor, see what the data looks like?
   3. How about you run with it? Can you see if the data shows your movement pace?
4. Find the recorded `.csv` file (check the filename as it indicates the time of record) in the `data_capture` folder under the `mu code` ( you can find this folder via Windows search).
5. Copy the content of the recorded `csv` to Google Sheet application, and make a plot for each dimension. Or you can plot all the three dimensions in the same chart. It is outside the scope of our coding class, however it is an essential skill of data analysis. Analyze your data by inspecting the plotted chart:
   1. How long does the movement last?
   2. What is the max / min reading from the accelerometer ?
   3. Which dimension/axis has the biggest variation (data changes) ?
6. This [link](https://microbit-challenges.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/accelerometer.html) provides additional detail about the accelerometer, and will be helpful in this task.
7. Prepare your charts and write down your findings about your experiment, for a quick presentation in the next class.
8. Additionally, you can record some other sensors in a similar way, for example, temperature sensor, sound input, and magnetic sensor.
